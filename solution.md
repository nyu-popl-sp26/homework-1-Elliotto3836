## Solution to Problem 1

(a)

The use of pi at line 4 is bound on line 3 because it is in the local 
scope of the circumference function.

The use of pi on line 7 is bound on line 1 because there is no other pi in the scope of the area function.

(b)

The use of x at line 3 is bound at line 1, because the x at line 3 is from
the 

The use of x at line 11 is bound at line 1, because it is in the global scope, not the local scope of the function.
